I saw the Movie, IT.  I want to add a review:  IT was scary at times, but the scenes often felt forced and predictable.  When I truly get scared by a movie, it is because I don't know what will happen next.  When I'm in a state of unsettled expectation and can't predict how the scene plays out in some horrific way, that's when I'm the most frightened and gripped by a move.  IT had none of that.  I knew when Pennywise was about to make an appearance in some form or another.  IT was never suspenseful.  The child actors did a very good job playing their roles.  I just think the direction left something to be desired.  I would give it 5 out of 10.


I want to review Mel Brook's History of the World Part I:  This was the funniest movie ever and Mel Brooks at his funniest.  The musical number for the Spanish Inquisition was brilliant.  Gregory Hines is a comedic genius.  Many of the greats are here (Madeline Kahn, Mel Brooks, Dom DeLuise, Harvey Korman, Cloris Leachman).  I just needed Marty Feldman and Gene Wilder to fill out the bunch.  10/10!


Thor: Love and Thunder was terrible.  After Thor: Ragnarök, also by Taika Waititi, Love and Thunder was a complete letdown.  The humor that was so artfully woven into Ragnarök was a blunt instrument in Love and Thunder and most of the jokes fell flat.  The story line was absurd and there was nothing to help me suspend disbelief as in other Marvel movies.  1/10.  Very disappointed.
